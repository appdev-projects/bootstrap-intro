# Bootstrap Intro

## Setup

 1. From [your Cloud9 repositories list](https://c9.io/account/repos), set up a workspace [as usual](https://guides.firstdraft.com/starting-on-a-project-in-cloud9).
 1. Set up the project: `bin/setup`
 1. Start the web server by clicking "Run Project".
 1. Navigate to your live application preview.
 1. There are a list of starting points and targets on the home page of the application. Click through the targets and explore. In this project all of the targets are internal URLs, not external; so you have the code at hand to refer to.

## Connect the assets to your own projects in the future

Ultimately, to get all of Bootstrap's functionality, include the following lines in the `<head>` of your documents. You will find these lines already in the application layout file of [the `final-project` repo](https://github.com/appdev-projects/final-project/blob/c9e7424ea1b9b20658d8d0be0bf931ebec2a4875/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb#L23), initially commented out; uncomment them to use them in the final project, but you should probably then remove the `<link>` to `light.css`:

```html
<!-- Connect Bootstrap CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">

<!-- Connect Bootstrap JavaScript -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>

<!-- Make it responsive to small screens -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
```
